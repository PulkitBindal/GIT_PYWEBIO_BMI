# GIT_PYWEBIO_BMI
In this repository, what I am going to do is that I am going to calculate the particular BMI of each and every individual. Using a very beautiful library of Python i.e., pywebio . The cool part is that, this application is not made up of HTML CSS and neither JavaScript, it is completely made of Python code :)
